# A short preprocessing script to divide a dataset (CSV format) into a 
# training set CSV and a test set CSV for use with machine learning algorithms.
# The original dataset with speed dating experiment information was downloaded 
# from Kaggle.

# It had 8378 rows and about 195 columns.

#1) Let's gather data about the original test set.

#with the large csv file
